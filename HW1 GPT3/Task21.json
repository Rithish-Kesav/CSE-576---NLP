            "Output": "Pope Leo X was the main target of Luther's ire. Luther took exception to the pope's practice of selling indulgences, which were basically pardons for sins that had already been committed. Luther argued that this practice was wrong and that people should not have to pay for their sins. He also took issue with the pope's authority, questioning his right to make decisions about salvation.Luther's criticisms of the Catholic Church led to his excommunication from the Church. He then began to gather followers who shared his beliefs. This led to the split of the Catholic Church and the rise of Protestantism.The Protestant Reformation had a profound impact on the world. It led to the split of the Catholic Church and the rise of Protestantism. It also had a significant impact on politics, culture, and society. The world would be very different if the Protestant Reformation had never happened."

            "Output": "John Calvin was a major figure in the Protestant Reformation. He was born in Noyon, France in 1509. His father, Gérard Cauvin, was a successful lawyer and Calvin was destined for the same profession. However, Calvin's life changed course when he was sent to study at the University of Paris in 1523. There, Calvin came into contact with humanist ideas which would have a profound influence on his later thought.After a brief stint working as a lawyer, Calvin decided to become a priest. However, he was never ordained and instead began to study theology. Calvin's theology was shaped by his humanist education as well as his study of the Bible. He believed that the Bible was the supreme authority on all matters of faith and practice.Calvin's ideas began to gain traction in the 1530s. He wrote a number of influential works, including The Institutes of the Christian Religion, which outlined his theology. In 1536, Calvin fled from religious persecution in France and settled in Geneva, Switzerland. There, he helped to establish the Protestant church on a firm footing.The Protestant Reformation had a profound impact on the world. It led to the split of the Catholic Church and the rise of Protestant"
