One way is to hire a research company to conduct surveys and focus groups with consumers in the target countries. This can be expensive, but it can give the company detailed information about what consumers in each country think about the company and its products or services. Another way to develop a statistics report is to collect data from existing customers. This can be done through customer surveys or by analyzing customer data that the company already has on hand. Finally, the company can use publicly available data, such as data from government agencies or data from other research companies, to develop their statistics report."
