                    "Answer": "There is no one answer to this question as there were a variety of factors that contributed to the reformation. Some of the main reasons include the corruption of the church, the rise of humanism, the influence of the printing press, and the frustration of the peasant class. Additionally, many people were dissatisfied with the Catholic Church's stance on indulgences, which were basically pardons that could be bought from the Church in order to reduce time in purgatory. This practice was seen as corrupt by many, and helped to fuel the reformation."

                    "Answer": "The main ideas of the Protestant reformation were centered around the idea of sola Scriptura, or 'scripture alone.' This meant that the Bible was the sole authority on religious matters, and that the Pope and Church councils did not have the final say. Additionally, the reformers advocated for a return to simplicity in the Church. They believed that the Church should get rid of all of the excesses and focus on the essentials of the faith."

The reformation also led to increased religious toleration, as different Christian denominations were allowed to exist side-by-side. Additionally, the reformation helped to spur on the scientific revolution, as the emphasis on individual study led to new discoveries in a variety of fields."
